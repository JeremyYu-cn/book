- Lexical Analysis: divides program text into "words" or "tokens"
- Parsing: to understand sentences structure
- Semantic Analysis: try to understand the sentence meaning.
- Optimization: automatic modify programs so that they run more fast and use less momery.
- Code Generation: a translation into another language.

## Economy

### Why are there so many programming languages?

- Application domains have distinctive/conflicting needs.

### Why are there new programming languages?

- Programmer training is the domain cost for a programming languages.
- Widely used language are slow to change.
- Easy to start a new language.
- Productivity > Training cost
- Languages adpoted to fill a void.

### What is a good programming language?

- There is no universally accepted metric for language design.
- A good language is one people use?
