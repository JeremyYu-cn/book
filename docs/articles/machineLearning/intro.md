## Definition of machine learning

> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programmed. Arthur Samuel(1959)

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- Supervised learning

  - Supervised learning used most in real-world applications
  - Rapid advancements
  - Input X and output Y, x to y mapping
  - Learns from being given "right answers"

- Unsupervised learning

  - Find something interesting in `unlabeled` data.
  - `Clustering` is one of the unsupervised learning methods.
  - Definition: Data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y. Algorithm has to find `structure` in the data.
  - Anomaly detection. To find unusual data points.
  - Dimensionality reduction. Compress data using fewer numbers.

- Practical advise for applying learning algorithms is important
