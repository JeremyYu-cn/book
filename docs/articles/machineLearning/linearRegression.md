### Linear Regression Model

- Training set: Data used to train the model

- Notation: x = "input" variable feature; y = "output" variable; m = number of training examples

training set -> learning algorithm -> function (model to predition y)

- Linear regression with `one` variable.

### Cost Function

$$
\frac{1}{2m} \sum_i=1^m\(y1^i - y^i\)^2
$$

m = number of training examples
