### Aims

- To provide a deep and systematic understanding of the nature and conduct of Computer Science research
- To enable students to undertake independent research
- To enhance existing transferable key skills
- To develop high-order transferable key skills
- To remind students of the Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional (LSEP) issues applicable to the computer industry

### Learning Outcomes

- Have an understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to extend, create and interpret knowledge in Computer Science
- Have a conceptual understanding sufficient to:

  - evaluate critically current research and advanced scholarship in Computer Science, and
  - propose possible alternative directions for further work

- Be able to:

  - deal with complex issues at the forefront of the academic discipline of
    Computer Science in a manner, based on sound judgments, that is both systematic and creative,
  - demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems within the domain of Computer Science,
  - act autonomously in planning and implementing solutions in a professional manner, and
  - define, plan, and/or carry out a project related to research and to communicate conclusions clearly to both specialists and non-specialists

- Make use of the qualities and transferable skills necessary for employment requiring:
  - the exercise of initiative and personal responsibility,
  - decision making in complex and unpredictable situations,
  - scientific risk identification, assessment and control, and
  - the independent learning ability required for continuing professional development
- Understand and participate within the professional, legal, social and ethical framework within which they would be expected to operate as professionals within the IT industry
- Have the skills set to be able to continue to advance their knowledge and understanding, and to develop new skills to a high level, with respect to continuing professional development as a “self-directed life-long learner” across the discipline of Computer Science

In short, you should learn to

- understand research and research methods in Computer Science
- be able to plan, and conduct your own research, taking into account ethical, legal, and professional limitations
- be able to communicate its results
