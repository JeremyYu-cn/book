# COMP528 Multi-Core And Multi-Processor Programming

## Terminology

- Parallelism:: Two or more processes that execute simultaneously and

- Concurrency: Two or more processes that excute simultaneously and share at least one resource

- Core: A processor that is built into a larger unit that can independently perform or process computational tasks

- Thread: A software concept, a single sequential flow or control in a program.

Node: What is normally thought of as 'one computer', one motherboard OpenMP to program within a node

- Cluster: 100 or 1000s or nodes connected throgh high-speed interconnections, low latency and high bandwidth

### Objectives for HPC (High Performance Computing)

- Minimise the total time to solution
- Maximise throughput
- Maximise some resource
- Ability to solve problems considered too big for available memory

## Reading List

- Parallel programming in OpenMP By Rohit Chandra

- Parallel programming with MPI By Peter Pacheco

- Using MPI – Portable Parallel Programming with the Message–Passing Interface

## Using a HPC cluster

### Structure of a cluster

- There are one or more login nodes.
- There are multiple compute node.
- There may be speciality nodes for specific tasks.
- There are one or more shared disks.
